# Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM Clean, BLE Scanner with Room, Koin, and JUnit 5

Scan your BLE devices with my new Jetpack Compose app. BLE scans include:

* The device name, if known
* The MAC address
* A list of advertised services
* Manufacturer specific data, when possible
* and a timestamp of when the device was last seen

Includes partial support for [Microsoft Beacon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cdp/77b446d0-8cea-4821-ad21-fabdf4d9a569).

In this video, I go over my data layer, which includes a pre-populated Room database. Iâ€™ll also
go over my corresponding JUnit 5 tests. This video features:

* Nordic's [Bluetooth Numbers Database](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/bluetooth-numbers-database)
* DB Browser for SQLite
* Room Entities, Dao
* Koin Dependency Injection
* JUnit 5 data layer and Room tests

## Video 2: Android BLE Scanner, Compose Bluetooth Permissions, Koin, and JUnit 5 Tests

https://youtu.be/NqxpAq_5wZs

Check out the user interface for my Android BLE Scanner app, written in Jetpack Compose. I'll go
over my Koin setup, Bluetooth permissions, composables, ScanResult parser, and JUnit 5 tests.

## Video 3: Connect to BLE Devices, Read/Write/Parse Characteristics and Descriptors with Android Bluetooth Gatt

https://youtu.be/mjDDJ3HaBGg

Learn how I use Bluetooth Gatt to connect to my BLE devices. In this video, I'll go over my Bluetooth
Gatt Callback, custom Characteristic parsers including Appearance, Preferred Connection Parameters,
and Client Characteristic Configuration, and my BLE Scanner ViewModel. I'll also go over my
Jetpack Compose BLE Service pager and Compose UI to interact with BLE devices.

## Video 4: Android App Compose Demo: Scan, Debug, and Control BLE Devices

In this demo, I go through my Light theme, Dark theme, Portrait and Landscape layouts, and my new 
Control screen, which allows me to control my BLE LED light strip.

## Video 5: Filter and Sort Room Flows, Compose Preview Parameters, JVM 11 JUnit 5 Compose Testing

I'm getting close to the finish line for my BLE Scanner app. In this video, I go over my recent
updates, including Adaptive Layouts, filter and sort features, Compose Preview Parameters, and 
Android tests.
